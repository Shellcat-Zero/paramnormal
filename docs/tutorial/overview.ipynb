    "In general, both in `numpy` and `scipy.stats` and in the field of statistics in general, you can refer to the *location* (`loc`) and scale (`scale`) of a distribution. Roughly speaking, they refer to the position and spread of the distribution, respectively. For normal (gaussian) distribtions `loc` refers the mean (symbolized as $\\mu$) and `scale` refers to the standard deviation (a.k.a. $\\sigma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem that `paramnormal` is trying to solve is that sometimes, creating a probability distribution using these parameters (and others) in `scipy.stats` can be confusing. Also the parameters in `numpy.random` can be inconsistently named (admittedly, just a minor inconvenience). "

    "> In probability theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable $X$ is log-normally distributed, then $Y = \\ln(X)$ has a normal distribution. Likewise, if $Y$ has a normal distribution, then $X = \\exp(Y)$ has a log-normal distribution. [(from wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)\n",

Finally, `loc` actually refers to a sort of offset that can be applied to entire distribution. In other words, you can translate the distribution up and down to e.g., negative values.\n",

    "In my field, civil/environmental engineering, variables that are often assumed to be lognormally distributed (e.g., pollutant concentration) can never have values less than or equal to 0. So in that since, the `loc` parameter **nearly always should be set to zero**.\n",
